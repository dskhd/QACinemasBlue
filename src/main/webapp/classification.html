				<p align="justify">U films should be set within a positive
					framework and should offer reassuring counter balances to any

					<b>12A/12 – Suitable for 12 years and over</b><br> Films
					classified 12A and video works classified 12 contain material that
					is not generally suitable for children aged under 12. No one
					younger than 12 may see a 12A film in a cinema unless accompanied
					by an adult. Adults planning to take a child under 12 to view a 12A
					film should consider whether the film is suitable for that child.
					To help them decide, we recommend that they check the BBFCinsight
					for that film in advance. No one younger than 12 may rent or buy a
					12 rated video work.
